drawing flowers with squares, using turtle

I visited an event "programming for beginners", organized and realized by [Open Tech School](http://www.opentechschool.org/). This is my project during this event and afterwards.
I'm not really a beginner, but I wanted to get some impulses on to how to start programming. 

This script draws five flowers, building a circle, using squares. You can set the side length of the square in the terminal and  the script will set the other values.

Many thanks to the Open-Tech-School-Mentors - I got the idea, could ask my questions and was encouraged to do math. :)

Where is the math? It's the value 1.9626, the radius of an incircle [isosceles triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle_and_excircles_of_a_triangle#Incircle), in German: [gleichschenkliges Dreieck](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkreis).

(sorry - my english is not good enough; I'm working on that)
