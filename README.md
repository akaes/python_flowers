drawing flowers with squares, using turtle

I visited an event "programming for beginners", organized and realized by [Open Tech School](http://www.opentechschool.org/). This is my project during this event and after this.
I'm not really a beginner, but I wanted to get some impulses how to start programming. 

This script draws five flowers, building a circle, using squares. You can put the sidelength of the square in line 4 and  the script will set the other values.

Many thanks to the Open-Tech-School-Mentors - I got the idea, could ask my questions and was encouraged to do math. :)

(sorry - my english is very bad; I'm working on that)
